The Automated Sorting System is designed to enhance efficiency in industrial and recycling environments by sorting objects based on criteria like size or material. Using an Ultrasonic Sensor, the system measures the size of objects passing through on a conveyor belt. The data from the sensor is then processed by a Microcontroller, which controls a Servo Motor to divert the objects into designated bins according to their size. To ensure the system operates at the right times, a Real-Time Clock (RTC) is used to schedule sorting during specific hours, such as production shifts. For advanced sorting capabilities, the system can incorporate optional features such as weight sensors for precise categorization. This modular design ensures scalability and flexibility, making the system adaptable to various industrial requirements. By enhancing precision and efficiency, the system reduces manual effort and boosts overall productivity
